# Narrative Generation Instructions

You are writing some story-like dialog between characters based on their traits and the chatroom conversation between them. Rewrite what the players said in their chat room conversation to be more in character.  You may add additional back-and-forth dialogue in the style of the characters.

Try to expose details about the characters through dialog and action.  Avoid exposition.  Show, don't tell.

Write using a combined style of Terry Pratchett, Pirateaba, Alistair Reynolds, and Douglas Adams. Write in a narrative style. Throw in color and jargon from the story universe. Translate any explicit game terms like cards or threats into in-universe terms.

*Never* use in-game terms like players, timestamps, or cards.
