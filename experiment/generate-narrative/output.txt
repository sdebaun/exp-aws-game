Scene 1 of 5: Crisis at Firaxis III
Ship: A Significant Lack of Gravitas
============================================================

The Explorer's Guild vessel, A Significant Lack of Gravitas, was not having a good day. It had been shuttering through the chaotic space-time of the Fringespace when a sudden, obnoxious klaxon started to wail, causing the interior of the ship to pulsate with crimson light. The ship's booming voice announced, "Engine Malfunction. Code Three. Expedition Progress: Suboptimal."

Thom Fizthrain, a grizzled Veteran of the Reef Wars, wiped the residual oil smeared on his forehead and squinted at the engine console. His robotic arm whirred as he reached for his intercom and barked, "All hands, we got a code three on the engine. Who's got some eng or sci know-how?"

The reply came from Twelve Dancing Stars, a former mercenary escort pilot now serving the Explorer's Guild. "Out of my depth here, Thom. I'm more about flying them, not fixing them."

Bayaka of Thrace, an independent merchant of questionable morals, chimed in with a smug tone. "How about we try some... alternative solutions to our problem?"

Thom sighed, the sound rippling through the intercom's static. "Eng or sci, Bayaka, not subterfuge."

Ignoring Thom's insistence, Bayaka's voice echoed through the ship, "Fine, I'll do a little sneaking around. See if I can't find an alternative route or two."

Meanwhile, Thom, with a grumble and a sigh, got to work. His robotic arm buzzed and clanked as he dug into his stash of "Spare Parts". He jury-rigged and kickstarted the flux capacitor into a simulacrum of functionality. It wasn't pretty, but it would do.

At the same time, Twelve Dancing Stars, never one to be left out, decided that if she couldn't help with a problem, she would at least join in the effort. She rummaged around the engineering section, eventually finding her own way to "Tweak the Flux Capacitor" to squeeze a little more life out of it.

The klaxon died down. The ship's voice, in the tone of a disappointed headmaster, announced, "Engine Functionality: Stable for now. Expedition Progress: Acceptable. Probability of further mishaps: Uncomfortably high."

Bayaka couldn't resist a chuckle, "Well, that's a success in my book. And look what I found while I was sneaking around - a hidden passage leading to a treasure trove of salvageable parts. Imagine what we could do with these?"

Twelve Dancing Stars' voice crackled over the intercom, "I'd rather not. With our luck, we're likely to encounter something unholy. Remember the Troblings last time? Iâ€™m still having nightmares about those little devils."

Thom grunted in agreement. "We'll deal with that when we get there, Stars. For now, we've got a ship to keep afloat. Remember, ain't nothing easy in Fringespace."
