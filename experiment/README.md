# Experiment Directory

This directory is a **deliberate catch-all** for code experiments, proofs-of-concept, and explorations that are NOT ready for production use.

## What Goes Here

- Quick and dirty prototypes
- AI prompt experiments
- Code spikes for testing new approaches
- Output files from test runs
- Half-baked ideas that might become features someday
- Failed experiments we're keeping for reference

## What This Is NOT

- Production code
- Clean, well-organized modules
- Code that follows our normal standards
- Something that needs to be "cleaned up"

## Important Notes

**DO NOT**:
- Refactor code in this directory unless actively working on promoting it to production
- Delete experiments without checking with the team
- Expect any code here to work reliably or be maintained
- Import code from here into production domains

**DO**:
- Add new experiments freely
- Keep rough notes about what each experiment was testing
- Check here first before starting a new proof-of-concept
- Move successful experiments to proper domains when ready

Think of this as our digital laboratory notebook - messy, full of crossed-out ideas, but occasionally containing gold.
