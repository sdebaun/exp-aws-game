# About the River of Souls

The River of Souls is a role-playing game.  It takes place at the end of time, at the heat-death of the universe, in an artificial simulated world constructed by a singularity AI.  The goal of the AI is to let simulated people continue to experience existence, without them knowing that they are simulations.

Unfortunately, due to the trillions of years of history, and the general breakdown of the AI, it has difficulty distinguishing between real history and science fiction and fantasy.  So the people it creates are not just extrapolations of people from real historical periods, but also are generated from well-established, named science fiction and fantasy lore.

The characters in the River of Souls have no idea that they are simulated beings living inside a simulation.  As far as they can tell, they have been suddenly transported to this strange world, and it is very real.

The world of the River of Souls consists of an endless string of river valleys, linked only by narrow treacherous channels, like rapids or waterfalls.

Each valley is its own ecosystem, almost entirely cut off from the other valleys.  Any given valley may have any strange combination of flora, fauna, and cultures from both history and fiction.
