# Users

There are two general aspects of users.  They are both encompassed in the same user account.  They are:
- Player.  The player aspect likes participating in stories and playing their characters and accumulating a great library of stories they've participated in.  Think of them like actors, and players in a RPG.
- Spectator.  The spectator aspect likes reading stories that others have generated.  They see themselves as a superfan, as a critic, as an appreciator of great stories.  They like encouraging players through their contribution of Ink, and having some voice in the challenges that Players face.

Note that any given user may consist of any combination of the Player and Spectator aspect.
