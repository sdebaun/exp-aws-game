This game is an ongoing web-based social game.

Aspects:
- Players control Lineages, which have one or more Characters.
- Players send their Characters on Expeditions.
- Expeditions last six real-time days, called Beats.
- During a Beat, Players communicate in an out-of-character (OOC) chat room about what their characters are going to do during that Beat.
- By the end of the Beat, Players will have chosen what Action Card they will play.
- When the Beat concludes, the game engine will calculate the individual contribution and expedition progress based on what Action Cards the players have played.
- When the Beat concludes, the game engine will use chatgpt to generate a readable narrative of the Beat.  This narrative will account for the OOC chat between the players, the Action Cards the players chose to play, and the consequences.
