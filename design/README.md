# Design Pillars
- unique and engaging (not generic) game world
- players build a roster of characters generated with AI including character portraits
- players enter their characters into runs with other player characters
- those runs last multiple days
- core game loops are yet undecided
- players can chat with other players in their run with "Out of Character" (OOC) chat.
- on a regular basis, the OOC chat and in-game actions are converted to narrative and in-character (IC) dialog.
- runs are converted into narrative fiction on a regular basis
- players can spectate runs they are not a part of, but only see the AI-generated narrative and IC dialog.
- spectators can interact with a run by voting for challenges, best played characters, who knows what else i come up with

# Currencies

## Ink

Ink is the primary currency used to drive AI-generated content.  Any action that requires an AI api call should be covered by Ink expenditure.

Ink can be created from a variety of sources:
- new account generation grants the account some fixed starter Ink.
- a free subscription gives the account a very small daily ink income, enough to vote in active scenes or unlock completed scenes.
- a paid subscription gives the account a daily ink income sufficient to join a new story every N days.
- microtransactions allow purchase of additional Ink at any time.

Ink can be transferred in one primary way:
- accounts can view in-progress scenes for free
- accounts can pay a small Ink fee to unlock any completed scene from any story
- accounts can spend Ink to vote on various options in an active scene
