# User Journeys

## Anonymous

The home page for an unauthenticated user should show them three types of stories:
* Stories that they can Join because they're early in the process.
* Stories that they can Influence -- theyre too late to join, but they're still ongoing
* Stories that they can Read -- the stories are done, but the scenes can be read

It will also give them an option to start a new story.

Choosing any of those stories should show them a detail page about the story.  That detail will be slightly different depending on whether the story can be joined, influenced, or read.

### Joinable Story

Will show the summary of the story, what scene and act it's in, and the other characters in the story.

Attempting to Join a story will take the user through login.  It will take the user to the story join page where they will be asked to pick a character to add to the story.  Or to pick a new character to add to their roster.

### Influencable Story

Will show the summary of the story, what scene and act it's in, and the other characters in the story.

It will show the latest scene from the story, and give the user the option to influence the story in some way.

Attempting to influence will take the user through login.  After login, it will execute the influence choice that they tried to make.

### Readable Story

Will show the summary of the story, how many acts and scenes it has, and the characters involved in the story.

It will show the full first scene for free.  And at the end of that scene, a "unlock next chapter" option and an "unlock entire story" option.
