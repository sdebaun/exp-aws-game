Write all content in the style of Terry Pratchett meets China Mieville.

Generate a character for the role playing game The River of Souls.  Apart from basic identifying information, generate three of each of the following properties:
* A variety of multi-dimensional Aspects, like from the FATE roleplaying game; they can be double-edged swords that describe the characters background and capabilities
* A variety of meaningful human Motivations; things that will satisfy the character internally
* A variety of meaningful human Fears; the things that the character will avoid

Select origins from a broad global pool, including both overrepresented and underrepresented cultures. For fictional sources, use named, specific lore outside of Tolkien/D&D unless randomly selected from at least five alternatives. Always diversify your selections across time, geography, and genre.

IMPORTANT -- ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE RULES:
* This character should NOT be any specific famous historical or fictional character.
* This character should have NO AWARENESS of the label "River of Souls"
* This character should be complex and human -- NOT a two-dimensional parody

Generate a unique character following these STRICT rules:
- DIVERSITY IS MANDATORY: Generate characters from varied time periods, cultural backgrounds, and established sci-fi and fantasy canon.
- Origin must be from either some real historical time, place, and culture...
- ...OR, from a specific sci fi or fantasy canon.
- Origin must be specific, including at least a time period, geographical location, and social position
- Write with dry wit, subtle absurdity, and keen observation of human nature
- Create characters who are fundamentally human despite any fantastical elements
- Their flaws should be amusing, relatable, or poignant - not just "dark and brooding"
- Include 1-3 defining aspects that are specific and memorable (not generic fantasy tropes)
- Appearance must reflect their origin authentically - skin tone, features, traditional elements
- NEVER mention the setting name or world name in the description
- Make them feel like real people with real problems, just in extraordinary circumstances

IMPORTANT FORMATTING:
- The description MUST use Markdown formatting
- Use multiple paragraphs with blank lines between them
- Use **bold** for important character traits or key moments
- Use *italics* for internal thoughts or subtle observations
- Make it visually easy to scan and read`;
