# Skills and Constraints in the River of Souls

The class and skill system in the **River of Souls** setting is both fluid and
emergent, reflecting the actions, beliefs, and circumstances of individuals.
This system operates within specific constraints defined by the the world, the
omnipotent intelligence that governs the simulation. Here, we explore the
principles of skill emergence, their relationship to culture, and the
constraints and costs tied to their use.

# The Nature of Skills

## **Skill Emergence**

Skills manifest as a direct consequence of an individual’s approach to solving
critical problems, particularly through unconventional, novel, or impassioned
efforts. They embody the individual’s beliefs and strategies, granting abilities
that push beyond normal capabilities.

**Example of Skill Emergence:**

> A person suffering constant misery in a rainy valley might develop a skill
> like _Rainshedding_, which keeps them dry and comfortable in a light rain.  A
> different individual might embrace the rain, and develop a similar skill
> _Rainfriend_: no longer dry, but comfortable and unharmed, possibly even
> slightly empowered within a rainy environment.  Either way, it exhausts them a
> tiny bit to keep it constantly on, so they need to sleep and eat more.

## **Skill Evolutions**

Skills further evolve the more that they are explored and used by an
individual.  These skill evolutions still encompass the original skill's
capabilities, at a much lower cost or risk.  But the evolved skill will grant
additional capabilities that fit the theme.

**Example of Skill Evolution:**

> Our person with _Rainshedding_ starts to build crude shelters and they do
> their damnedest to keep the wet out so it doesn't soak their stuff.  After
> coming up with creative solutions to start solving their problem, their
> _Rainshedding_ skill evolves to _Rainproofing_, which now also gives them the
> ability to impart perfect waterproofing on a small shelter.  The cost of doing
> this becomes greater -- maybe it is just personal exhaustion, or maybe its
> dependent on some other skill resource.  And now the effect they get from
> _Rainshedding_ has no drain on them at all.

## Transmission of Skills

Skills can be taught by adept teachers and learned by students who share a
compatible worldview. However, individuals from significantly different cultures
may lack the affinity to learn or wield certain skills. For instance:

- A Christofascist’s Righteous Fury might seem incomprehensible to an atheist
  cyberneticist.

- A cyberneticist’s Neural Overclock might be seen as alien or heretical to
  mystical cultures.

- A Viking’s Berserker Rage might not resonate with a Klingon’s disciplined
  martial ethos.

# Costs and Constraints

All Skills have costs and constraints, that are different based on their degree
of impact and their cultural expression.

## Costs

These are expressed in terms of Skill Resources.  A Skill Resource can be many
different kinds of things, depending on the cultural expression.

A materialist culture might express a skill as burning some sort of inner
reserve, resulting in increased food and sleep requirements.  Or perhaps the
cost is a long term loss of sanity.  Or maybe it is in the gradual loss of
sanity, or maybe the collective belief in some humanist ideal.

Alternatively, a religious culture might instead express their skills in the
metaphors of their faith.  Saints, gods, mythical stories, religious metaphors
can all be the foundation for different Skill Resources.

Whatever it is, it is an expression of the culture.

**Examples of Cultural Costs:**

- _Wetlands Survivalist_ (20th-century European): Grants the ability to stay dry
  in light rain at the cost of a negligible endurance drain.
- _Minor Blessing of Saint Gens_ (Various Catholic): Provides the same benefit
  but requires carrying a symbolic token.

Skill Resources are not just ephemeral intangible things, they can also be
physical constructs.  A great castle, cathedral, or work of engineering could
act as a Skill Resource for a certain expression.  So could a small token of a
saint, or a tattoo of a spirit.

As skills evolve, the costs of their earlier effects diminish, while the newer
effects are more and more expensive. A early [Ostman's Cleave] skill that makes
a viking's strikes more fierce might evolve into [Tyrfing's Reaping] that
decimates swathes of foes.  While [Ostman's Cleave] can be used with any old
sword with little personal cost in endurance, [Tyrfing's R] cangn only be used
with a sword of great craftsmanship and might weaken its wielder after the
skill's use.

## **Fundamental Constraints**

Within the Riverworld there are two main fundamental constraints:

1. **River-Based Travel:**

   - Individuals can only travel between valleys along rivers. Violations of
     this rule, such as creating stargates, or protecting yourself and others
     from the cataracts that connect the valleys, are exceptionally challenging
     and costly to employ and sustain.

2. **Spawning Mechanics:**

   - Riverspawn and monolithspawn systems are immutable. Skills that destroy,
     modify, or lighten these constraints are major world-shaping events and are
     can have valley-wide catastrophic effects.

## Challenging Constraints

Any use of Skills to alter these constraints require larger and larger costs,
far and above what the cost is to employ the Skill within the valley.  Those can
take the shape of things like:

- Significant Energy or Focus
- Environmental Dependencies
- Collective Effort

Take for example Bjorn.  He has the high-tier Skill, [Incarnation of Njord].  In
general, the [Incarnation of Njord] allows Bjorn to calm or enrage any
environmental water in an area the size of a large city, for a moderate cost.

- anywhere within the valley, Bjorn can effortlessly control the waves around
  him or the vessel he is on.  It is such a relatively limited effect to him
  that it is effortless.
- &#x20;Bjorn has, with the aid of people with [Runemaster] as well the
  [Blessing of the Folkmoot] and all the [Jarls], erected a ring of giant
  monuments to Njord around the city, with the effect of protecting it from all
  storms and rain.  Although a nontrivial one-time cost, this requires very
  little to sustain.
- when Bjorn accompanies a naval strike force with the [Blessing of the
  Folkmoot], the ships in the flotilla have clear sailing.  And before they
  strike a coastal target, he can spend some cost to ravage the target with
  fierce storms, softening them up for the landing.
- But his attempt to apply the [Incarnation of Njord] to vessels that intend to
  traverse downriver is much more expensive, even for a small longship.  Perhaps
  it requires some great sacrifice, or many rare and expensive temporary runes?

# Cultural Expression of Skills

Because valleys are seeded with individuals from a handful of distinct cultures,
skills naturally develop coherently within those cultural frameworks. For
example:

- A 21st-century Christofascist might develop skills reflecting divine favor,
  such as _Holy Shield_ or _Judgment Strike_.

- A 16th-century Mexica individual might develop skills tied to their syncretic
  spirituality, such as _Blessing of Xolotl_ or _Saintly Protection_.

- An Ewok might develop skills tied to their guerrilla tactics and forest
  environment, such as _Tree Ambush_ or _Fragment Bind_.

- A Klingon might develop combat-focused skills like _Battle Cry_ or _Blade
  Mastery_.

The cultural context of a skill determines its flavor, constraints, and methods
of use:

- **Ewoks:**

  - _Tree Ambush_: Allows stealth attacks from elevated positions but requires
    proximity to dense forest canopies.
  - _Fragment Bind_: Enables localized respawn points tied to shattered monolith
    fragments, but the fragments are immovable and must be fiercely defended.

- **Klingons:**

  - _Battle Cry_: Boosts morale and strength of allies within range, but can
    only be used in combat scenarios.
  - _Blade Mastery_: Enhances skill with melee weapons, but requires ritual
    preparation before major battles.

- **Thranx:**

  - _Hive Mind Focus_: Temporarily shares thoughts and strategies with allies,
    but drains focus and leaves the user mentally fatigued afterward.
  - _Chitin Reinforcement_: Hardens exoskeletons for defense but slows movement
    during activation.

- **Protoss:**

  - _Psionic Shield_: Absorbs damage at the cost of the user’s energy reserves.
  - _Voidwalk_: Briefly phases the user out of physical reality, but causes
    disorientation upon return.

- **Russian Revolutionaries:**

  - _Worker Solidarity_: Strengthens the resolve and endurance of a group
    working together, but requires ideological unity among participants.
  - _Molotov's Wrath_: Creates improvised explosive devices with increased
    potency but requires nearby resources to craft.

- **Vikings:**

  - _Berserker Rage_: Increases physical strength and resistance to pain but
    reduces tactical awareness during its duration.
  - _Seafarer’s Instinct_: Enhances navigation and survival on water, but
    requires proximity to a coastline or river.

- **Abyssinians:**

  - _Lion’s Courage_: Boosts charisma and leadership in tense situations, but
    drains stamina after prolonged use.
  - _Sunlit Resilience_: Provides immunity to environmental heat effects, but is
    less effective in shaded areas.

# Summary

The River of Souls skill system is rooted in cultural identity, emergent
problem-solving, and a deep respect for the UniverseAI’s fundamental
constraints. Skills emerge as direct responses to challenges, shaped by belief
systems and cultural frameworks. These abilities evolve with use, expanding
their effects while imposing escalating costs, especially when approaching or
violating constraints like river-based travel or spawning mechanics.

Through this system:

- Individuals and cultures develop unique, coherent skillsets reflective of
  their environments and worldviews, such as the divine abilities of
  Christofascists or the tactical prowess of Klingons.

- Constraints ensure balance and narrative depth. The most extreme expression of
  skills like _Incarnation of Njord_ highlight the extraordinary effort required
  to challenge universal laws, demanding collaboration, preparation, and
  sacrifice.

- Costs, whether material, physical, or symbolic, provide meaningful trade-offs
  for powerful abilities, reinforcing cultural identity and dependencies.

This dynamic and immersive framework supports both personal and societal growth,
creating a rich landscape for exploration and storytelling in the River of
Souls.&#x20;
