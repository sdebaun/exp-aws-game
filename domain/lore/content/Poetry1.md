# Fairytale of New York
- the pogues
- covered by puddles pity party, storm large

It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one
And then he sang a song
The Rare Old Mountain Dew
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true
They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing Galway Bay
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day
You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing Galway Bay
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day
I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing Galway Bay
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

# Blue Green
- Jonwayne, Low Leaf

[Intro]
What's wrong with you boy?
Don't you- don't you want to grow up to be a man?

[Verse 1: Jonwayne]
I just cancelled my tour, I just woke up in bed
I had last nights dinner on the sheets
I had a burning in my throat I couldn't swallow
I had shuffled to the mirror and saw death over my head
If I was sleeping on my back I would've died
Jameson in my blood, Jameson in my eyes
Jameson on my mind, I know I need to stopâ€”
But if I'm flying, it's Jameson on the ride
This how I'm making money but it's costin' my life
Digging in my arms over turbulent flights
Walking down the aisle, blood from where I scratched
Stewardess looking worried but she's too afraid to ask
So if you find me in the state, please, give me two
Its just me slipping through these greens and these blues
I know that sounds foolish but who knew that I'd be living the life I barely knew but always dreamed of?
And you'd sweep anything under these rugs to let 'em all know your name, that's a dangerous drug
Runnin' a marathon but with batons and get gone when you're asked to pass it on
Pass it on

[Verse 2: Low Leaf]
I awaken to a new day
I create who I'm becoming
Connect to something
A journey through the desert, city, and these hills
They're running through these hills now
I be running through these hills now
I be running through these hills now

# Breezeblocks
- alt-j

[Verse 1]
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine, your fever's gripped me again
Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops (La la la la)
Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey (La la la la)
Break down, now weep, build up breakfast
Now let's eat, my love, my love, love, love (La la la la)

[Chorus]
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me, but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
And I, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey (La la la la)
Break down, now sleep, build up breakfast
Now let's eat, my love, my love, love, love (La la la la)
She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots
Hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She's morphine, queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love (La la la la)

# Ben's My Friend
- Sun Kill Moon

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, August 3rd
It's been a pretty slow and uneventful summer
Went to visit a friend in Santa Fe
Went to New Orleans and went to see my family
Woke up this morning and it occurred
I needed one more track to finish up my record
I was feeling out of fuel and uninspired
Laid on my bed too long, a little down, a little tired
Met my girl and we walked down Union Street
I was scattered and my head was in a bunch of places
Bought a $350 pair of lampshades
And we ate at Perry's and I ordered crab cakes

[Break 1]
Blue crab cakes
Blue crab cakes
Blue crab cakes

[Verse 2]
She said I seemed distracted and asked what was going on with me
I said, "I can't explain it, it's a middle age thing"
She said, "Okay," and ate her eggs Benedict
And I looked at the walls cluttered with sports bar shit

[Break 2]
Sports bar shit
Sports bar shit
Sports bar shit

# Motorcycle Drive By
- third eye blind

[Verse 1: Stephan Jenkins]
Summer time and the wind is blowing outside
In lower Chelsea and I don't know
What I'm doing in this city
The sun is always in my eyes
It crashes through the windows
And I'm sleeping on the couch
When I came to visit you
That's when I knew
That I could never have you
I knew that before you did
Still I'm the one who's stupid

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I've never been so alone
And I've never been so alive

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by
The cigarette ash flies in your eyes
And you don't mind, you smile
And say the world doesn't fit with you
I don't believe you, you're so serene
Careening through the universe
Your axis on a tilt, you're guiltless and free
I hope you take a piece of me with you
And there's things I'd like to do
That you don't believe in
I would like to build something
But you never see it happen

# Rebel Waltz
- the clash, sandanista!

I slept as I dreamed of a time long ago
I saw an army of rebels, dancin' on air
I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfire
A song of the battle, that was born in the flames
The rebels were waltzin' on air

I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz
That was written to be danced on the battlefield
I danced to the song of a voice of a girl
A voice that called "Stand 'til we fall
Stand 'til all the boys fall"

As we danced came the news that the war was not won
Five armies were comin', with carriage and gun
Through the heart of the camp
Swept the news from the front
A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food
We knew the war could not be won

So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun
In a glade through the trees I saw my only one
Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun
The soldiers were dyin', there was a tune to the sighin'
The song was an old rebel one

As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field
My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees
I slept as I dreamt, I saw the army rise
A voice began to call, "Stand 'til you fall"
The tune was an old rebel one

# Bathed in Sound
- cosmo sheldrake

[Verse 1]
Closed my eyes
Went to sleep
And drifted downwards
I dreamt of whales
Floating there
All bathed in sound

[Chorus]
All wrapped in plankton (Oooo)
And glinting green (Oooo)
Drifting onwards (Oooo)
Through shifting seas (Oooo)

[Verse 2]
Closed my eyes
Went to sleep
And drifted downwards
I dreamt of whales
Floating there
All bathed in sound

[Chorus]
All wrapped in plankton (Oooo)
And floating 'round us (Oooo)
Alive with purpose (Oooo)
And with a will (Oooo)

# Its My Life
- talk talk
- 1997 remaster

[Verse 1]
Funny how I find myself in love with you
If I could buy my reasoning, I'd pay to lose
One half won't do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've asked myself, how much do you
Commit yourself?

[Chorus]
It's my life, don't you forget
It's my life, it never ends (It never ends)

[Verse 2]
Funny how I blind myself, I never knew
If I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd tell myself, what good you do
Convince myself

[Chorus]
It's my life, don't you forget
It's my life, it never ends (It never ends)

# Independence Day
- difranco, ani

We drove the car to the top of the parking ramp
4th of July
Sat out on the hood with a couple of warm beers
And watched the fireworks explode in the sky
And there was an exodus of birds in the trees
Cuz they didn't know that we were only pretending
And the people all looked up and looked pleased
And the birds flew around like the whole world was ending

I don't think war is noble
And I don't like to think that love is like war
But I've got a big hot cherry bomb
And I wanna slip it through the mail slot
Of your front door

And now you can't leave me here
I've got your back now
You'd better have mine
Cuz you say the coast is clear
But you say that all the time

So many sheep I quit counting
Sleepless and embarassed
About the way that I feel
Trying to make molehills out of mountains
Building base camp at the bottom
Of a really big deal
Did I ever tell you how I stopped eating
When you stopped calling me
I was cramped up
And shitting rivers for weeks
And pretending that I was finally free

# Cure for Pain
- Morphine

[Verse 1]
Where is the ritual?
And tell me where, where is the taste?
Where is the sacrifice?
And tell me where, where is the faith?

[Chorus]
Someday there'll be a cure for pain
That's the day I throw my drugs away
When they find a cure for pain

[Verse 2]
Where is the cave
Where the wise woman went?
And tell me where
Where's all that money that I spent?

[Bridge]
I propose a toast
To my self control
You see it crawlin' helpless on the floor

[Chorus]
Someday there'll be a cure for pain
That's the day I throw my drugs away
When they find a cure for pain

# Mr Blue Sky
- Electric Light Orchestra

[Intro]
Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies

[Verse 1]
Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day
Hey-ey-hey

[Verse 2]
Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city
On the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today
Hey-ey-hey

[Chorus]
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long? (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

# Harder Than You Think
- Public Enemy

[Intro: Flava Flav]
Yo, Chuck, bust a move, man
I was on my way up here to the studio
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
And this brother stopped me and asked me, "Yo, wassup with that brother, Chuckie D? He swear he nice"
I said "Yo, the brother don't swear he's nice, he knows he's nice"
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
So Chuck, I got a feelin you turning him into a Public Enemy, man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me
On the way out to LA Laurelton Queens?
While we was in the car on our way to the Shop?
Well yo, right now kick the bass for them brothers
And let 'em know
What goes on!

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
Rolling Stones of the rap game, not bragging
Lips bigger than Jagger, not saggin'
Spell it backwards, I'ma leave it at that
That ain't got nothing to do with rap
Check the facts, expose those cats
Who pose as heroes and take advantage of blacks
Your government's gangster, so cut the crap
A war going on so where y'all at?
"Fight the Power" comes great responsibility
'F the Police' but who's stopping you from killing me?
Disaster, fiascos over a loop by P.E
If it's an I instead of we believing TV
Spitting riches, bitches, and this new thing about snitches
Watch them asses move as the masses switches
System dissed them but barely missed her
My sole intention to save my brothers and sisters

[Hook]

[Interlude: Flavor Flav]
Yeah, that's right Chuck, man
That's what you gotta do
You got to tell 'em "Just like dat," ya know what I'm sayin?
Cause yo, lemme tell you a lil something man
These brothers runnin around, hard-headed!
They get a lil jealous, you know what I'm sayin?
Just like that! You know, they try to bring you down wit 'em
But yo, Chuck, you got to tell 'em, "Just like dat!"

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Screamin gangsta twenty years later
Of course endorsed while consciousness faded
New generation believin them fables
"Gangster Boogie" on two turntables
Show no love so it's easy to hate it
Desecrated while the coroner waited
Any given Sunday, so where y'all rate it?
Wit slavery, lynchin, and them drugs infiltrated
I'm like that doll Chucky, baby
Keep comin back to live, love life like I'm crazy
Keep it movin Rising to the Top
Doug Fresh clean livin you don't stop
Revolution means change, don't look at me strange
So I can't repeat what other rappers be sayin
You don't stand for something, you fall for anything
Harder than you think, it's a beautiful thing


[Hook]
Hard (Get up!)

These brothers runnin around, hard-headed!
They get a lil jealous, you know what I'm sayin?
Just like that! You know, they try to bring you down wit 'em
But yo, Chuck, you got to tell 'em, "Just like dat!"

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
So it's time to leave you a preview
So you too can review what we do
Twenty years in this business, How You Sell Soul?
G-Wiz, people bear witness
Thank you for lettin us be ourselves
So don't mind me if I repeat myself
These simple lines be good for your health
To keep them crime rhymes on the shelf
Live love life like you just don't care
Five thousand leaders never scared
"Bring the Noise," it's 'the moment they feared'
Get up! Still a beautiful idea

[Hook]
Hard (Get up!)
