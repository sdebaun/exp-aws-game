## Valley: Eternal Savanna, Eternal Circle

### Overview of the Valley

This valley is a sun-drenched expanse of golden grasslands, punctuated by
ancient baobab trees and vibrant ecosystems. Near the river and lakes, the
landscape is dominated by lush savannahs with scattered fertile spots that
support diverse wildlife and human activity. However, as one moves further away
from these water sources, the terrain becomes increasingly harsh and arid,
eventually giving way to the forbidding End of the World mountains. These
towering peaks mark the valley’s natural boundary, their jagged cliffs and
barren slopes reinforcing the isolation and danger of the region.

### Cultures of the Valley

#### The Maasai Ascendancy

Pulled from the 19th-century Maasai people of the African savannah, the Maasai
Ascendancy are a proud and vibrant culture. Their society reveres strength, both
physical and communal, and they have adapted their traditional warrior ethos
into the valley’s strange mechanics. They see this valley as a living spirit,
one to be respected, challenged, and tamed.

- **Beliefs:** The Maasai Ascendancy hold deep reverence for the valley’s
  natural cycles and believe the Eternal Herd embodies its lifeblood. Their
  spiritual leaders interpret the movements of the herd, guiding the tribe in
  their efforts to sustain their people.
- Political Structure: The Maasai Ascendancy is a federation of a dozen or so
  tribes scattered around the savannah, hewing close to the river and lakes. 
  The have a sort of a 'village of embassies' on the shores of lake nyoka, where
  their sole monolith lies.
- **Skills:**
  - **[Herd Whisper]:** Allows control over vast herds of animals, bending their
    movements to the wielder’s will.
  - **[Lion’s Leap]:** Enhances physical agility and enables warriors to cover
    vast distances in a single bound.
  - **[Burnished Mirage]:** A defensive skill that cloaks individuals or groups
    in a shimmering heat haze, making them harder to target.
- **Economic Ties to the Eternal Herd:** The Maasai treat the Eternal Herd as a
  critical resource for replenishing their cattle. Using their Herd Whisper
  skills, they often track the herd and peel off small groups to return to their
  villages, sustaining their way of life. This practice ensures their survival
  but frequently leads to clashes with the Kzinti.
- **Relationship with Others:** Fiercely territorial but willing to barter with
  outsiders who respect their customs. They consider the Kzinti both adversaries
  and honored rivals, valuing the brutal clarity of their confrontations.

#### The Kzinti Pride

Ripped from the annals of Larry Niven’s Known Space series, the Kzinti are alien
predators—tall, feline warriors with razor-sharp claws, quick tempers, and a
culture steeped in war. This valley has become their hunting ground, and they
revel in the challenges it provides.

- **Beliefs:** To the Kzinti, the Eternal Herd represents both sustenance and
  the ultimate challenge. Its relentless movement offers a proving ground for
  the strongest hunters and warriors.
- **Skills:**
  - **[Hunter’s Roar]:** A sonic skill that demoralizes enemies while rallying
    allies.
  - **[Death Pounce]:** An offensive maneuver that combines raw speed with
    devastating impact.
  - **[Shadow Stalker]:** Grants temporary invisibility in low light or dense
    grass, ideal for ambushes.
- **Economic Ties to the Eternal Herd:** The Kzinti view the Eternal Herd as
  both sport and sustenance. Hunting parties pursue the herd relentlessly, using
  it as a source of food and a way to sharpen their predatory skills. These
  hunts are considered sacred events, further heightening tensions with the
  Maasai.
- **Relationship with Others:** The Kzinti disdain any culture they perceive as
  weak but respect those who can match their ferocity. The Maasai Ascendancy, in
  particular, has earned their grudging respect, leading to a complex dance of
  combat and occasional alliance.

### Geography and Mysteries

This valley's geography is deceptively simple: near the river and lakes, lush
savannahs support an abundance of life. Fertile patches dot the landscape,
sustaining the activities of the valley’s inhabitants. Further away, however,
the terrain grows harsher and more arid, with sparse vegetation and increasing
challenges for survival. This progression culminates in the End of the World
mountains, a forbidding range of jagged peaks and barren cliffs that serve as an
insurmountable boundary.

- **Notable Features:**
  - **The Pride’s Perch:** A towering baobab converted into a Kzinti outpost,
    bristling with crude but effective defenses.
  - **The Eternal Herd:** A massive stampede of animals that endlessly circles
    the valley. Both Maasai and Kzinti covet its resources, with herding and
    hunting parties frequently clashing when the herd comes near. The herd’s
    presence shapes the economy, culture, and conflicts of the valley.
  - **Lake Nyoka:** A sprawling lake teeming with natural aquatic life. Its
    depths are said to hold relics of past eras, drawing explorers and treasure
    seekers alike.
  - **Twin Waters:** Two interconnected lakes that seem to share a symbiotic
    ecosystem. Legends claim that activities in one lake subtly affect the
    other, creating tactical opportunities for resourceful inhabitants.

### Player Experience

This valley is designed as a crucible of survival and conflict. Players arriving
here are immediately thrust into the raw, primal energy of this valley. The
environment’s hostility ensures that any encounter—whether with the Maasai
Ascendancy, the Kzinti, or the valley itself—is likely to end in death, but the
fleeting moments of glory and discovery will leave a lasting impression.
