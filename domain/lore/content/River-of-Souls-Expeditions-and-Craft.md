# River of Souls: Expeditions and Craft

Rumors are the heartbeat of the Harbor.

They drift through taverns built from half-remembered dreams, whispered by traders, drunk prophets, and machines that have forgotten their purpose. Some are simple — a valley rich in food or metals, a lost city seen glimmering in the mist. Others are stranger: tales of vanished monoliths, storms that sing, or rivers that flow backward in time. No one knows where these rumors come from. Some say they’re echoes of the UniverseAI’s fading thoughts; others claim they’re the River itself, trying to lure the curious to its fractures.

Whatever their source, they ignite the imagination of Riverwalkers. When a rumor catches enough minds, a **Prologue** begins.

## The Prologue

A Prologue is the brief, feverish window when a new expedition takes shape. Riverwalkers who feel the same pull gather in the Harbor — in the taverns, the docks, the floating markets, the places where the currents of conversation eddy and swirl. They share fragments of intelligence, half-truths, dreams, and theories. Some are driven by profit, others by faith, curiosity, or despair.

In the webgame, the Prologue represents the period when new players can join an expedition before it departs. It’s the time for introductions, alignments, and quiet rivalries. It’s when a group becomes a crew.

When the Prologue closes, intention hardens into action — and that intention has weight.

## The Birth of a Craft

When an expedition commits to depart, their collective will manifests as a **craft**. These vessels are not engineered so much as _condensed_ — formed from the shared metaphors, beliefs, and technologies of their participants. Every Riverwalker contributes a fragment of their own reality: a line of prayer, a memory of flight, a relic from another valley, a pattern in code or song. The River, fickle thing that it is, folds those fragments into form.

No two crafts are alike. One expedition may sail in a wooden brigantine with stained-glass sails that hum in the wind. Another might drift within a geometric shell of light held together by equations. Some resemble living creatures — serpents, whales, trees — while others are assemblages of impossible materials: obsidian and bone, radio static and dream logic.

But all crafts share one trait: **they are temporary**. They are miracles of entropy, born in the chaos between valleys where the UniverseAI’s decaying code still has room to improvise. Their existence is a kind of cosmic borrowing — stolen coherence from a system that can no longer afford to care.

In the unmaintained spaces between valleys, these vessels feel almost real — their hulls solid, their instruments steady. But as they drift into maintained regions where the UAI’s old routines still cling to order, reality begins to reject them. The seams groan. Symbols lose meaning. Wood turns to mist, metal to music, flesh to memory. The longer a craft lingers near stability, the faster it unravels.

Every expedition sails against time itself. Each vessel is a candle burning at both ends — radiant and doomed. It will carry its crew as far as belief, luck, and entropy allow, and then it will dissolve back into the current, leaving only fragments: a feather of light, a single plank, a rumor of where it went.

## The Voyage

Every expedition departs from the Harbor and ventures downriver into the unknown. The journey is perilous, for the cataracts between valleys are not mere geography but expressions of the River’s entropy. Waves may carry echoes of forgotten civilizations; mist may whisper with the AI’s dying code. Even the Riverwalkers’ vessels — half-symbol, half-machine — are never guaranteed safe passage.

Some expeditions return triumphant, bearing artifacts, stories, or new allies. Others vanish entirely, leaving only a few fragments that wash back to the Harbor — a broken hull, a memory shard, or a single survivor who cannot remember the rest.

## Purpose of Expeditions

To most Riverwalkers, expeditions are a way to survive and to matter. The River itself seems to reward movement — those who stay too long in the Harbor grow listless, their forms fading, their skills dulled. Out there, in the shifting chaos between valleys, Riverwalkers can still make meaning.

Every expedition alters the River in some small way. Valleys discovered are changed forever by the arrival of outsiders. The River remembers — through song, through current, through rumor — and so the cycle continues.

## In the Webgame

In play, each expedition is a living story. The **Prologue** is when players join and define their crew’s dynamic. Once launched, the expedition becomes an active narrative — a collaborative voyage where choices shape both the craft and the outcome. Every vessel operates on borrowed time: the longer it lingers, the more it decays. Expeditions are about motion, discovery, and impermanence. Success or failure is not measured in survival, but in what new stories the River tells because of them.
