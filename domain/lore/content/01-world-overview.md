# The River of Souls

The River of Souls is a seemingly-endless sequence of river valleys, all linked together by one river.  Each valley is connected with a single upriver valley and a single downriver valley, and the connections always involve treacherous chasms, rapids, waterfalls, swirling mists, violent winds, you name it.

## The Valleys

The Valleys are as diverse as you can imagine.  Some contain hints of infinite worlds both real and imagined.  The entire range of factual and fictional geography, biology, and all those other relevant -ologies can be found in the Valleys.  The one constant is that through all of them, the River of Souls flows.

Within these Valleys live every sentient person (human or otherwise) that has ever existed, whether in fact or fiction.  From tribes of protohumans from prehistoric Earth, to futuristic cultures that existed only in book and film.

## Riverwalkers

Normally, travel from valley to valley via the dangerous connections is fatal.  And even if you do survive, you have no idea which valley you will end up in.

But rarely, people develop special capabilities that allow them to not just survive the valley connections, but control which valley they are taken to.

These people are called Riverwalkers.  While not unified by any stretch of the imagination, they have their own culture, politics, and society.  They interact with each other, and frequently embark on collective expeditions to explore or exploit new valleys.
