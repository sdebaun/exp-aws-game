# The Shattered Realms

## The World That Was

Once, there was an empire. Not just any empire - THE Empire. It spanned continents, commanded magics that could reshape mountains, and built cities that touched the clouds. Its scholars mapped the stars and its warriors conquered death itself.

That was before the Shattering.

## The Long Dying

No one remembers exactly how it began. Some say the Emperor's hubris finally caught the attention of things that should not be named. Others whisper of a grand experiment gone wrong, of mages who dug too deep into the fundamental forces of reality.

What matters is this: the Empire fell. Not in a day, not in a year, but in a cascade of disasters that took generations. Magic became wild and unpredictable. The great cities crumbled or worse - twisted into nightmarish parodies of their former glory. The very fabric of reality grew thin in places.

## The Age of Ashes

Now, centuries later, we live in the ruins. The world is broken into a thousand petty kingdoms, each claiming to be the Empire's true heir. Warlords and hedge-wizards rule from crumbling keeps. Ancient automata wander the wastes, following orders from masters long dead. 

In the wild places between settlements, reality itself cannot be trusted. The Veil - that invisible barrier between our world and the screaming chaos beyond - grows thinner each year. Things slip through. Some wear the faces of men. Some don't bother.

## The Demenses

In this dying world, a Demense is more than just a stronghold. It's a statement of defiance against entropy itself. Each one is unique - a fortress carved from the bones of the old world, shaped by the will and desperation of its master.

Some are traditional keeps, reinforced with scavenged Imperial stonework and whatever protective wards still function. Others are stranger things: repurposed factories where reality still follows the old rules, groves where the last true magic flows clean, or even fragments of other dimensions anchored to our dying earth.

Your Demense is your last stand. It's where you'll make your stand against the Long Dying. It's where your story begins... and where it might end.

## The Currency of Power

In the old days, gold meant something. Now? Gold won't stop a reality storm. Gold won't power a protective ward. Gold won't buy loyalty when the Veil tears and nightmares walk the earth.

Ink is different. Ink is liquid possibility, distilled from... well, that depends who you ask. Some say it's the blood of dead gods. Others claim it's condensed dreams, harvested from the sleeping and the mad. A few whisper it's the universe's own tears, weeping for what was lost.

What matters is this: Ink works. It fuels the old machines. It powers the spells that still function. Most importantly, it can reshape reality in small ways - enough to matter, not enough to break what's left of the world.

Guard your Ink well. In this broken world, it's the only currency that matters.
