# Valley: The Shattered Monolith

## Overview of the Valley

The Valley of the Shattered Monolith is a place of profound mystery and tension. Though its current inhabitants have only been present for roughly a century, the valley is steeped in history—and tragedy. The shattered monolith at its heart has left a legacy that shapes the valley’s towering forests, fantastical creatures, and strange phenomena. To the valley’s inhabitants, however, these features are merely parts of their environment: the great forest is an ominous and dangerous place, full of threats both mundane and otherworldly.

In this valley, the major landmarks are:

Jerusalem Monolith: The most upriver monolith, strategically and economically vital, controlled by the Kingdom of God.

Rio Sagrado Monolith: Located slightly downriver from Jerusalem, near the city of Rio Sagrado, this monolith serves as a focal point for the Mexica population.

Shattered Monolith: Far downriver, the remnants of this monolith are surrounded by the great forest. The mana hotzone here has warped the environment, making it a site of wonder and danger, and it is fiercely defended by the Ewoks.

This chapter explores the valley’s three primary cultures, their beliefs, their relationships, and the unique ways they interact with the valley’s environment and each other.

## The Kingdom of God

### Summary

The Kingdom of God is the dominant political entity in the valley, ruled by 21st-century Christofascists who call themselves "The Chosen." Their capital city, Jerusalem, is inhabited primarily by the Chosen, who see themselves as divinely ordained stewards of the valley. From Jerusalem, they exert control over the nearby city of Rio Sagrado and wage crusades against the forest-dwelling Ewoks.

### Society

The Kingdom of God is built on an uncompromising foundation of theocratic rule. Citizens of Jerusalem, the capital city, occupy roles of leadership, enforcement, and spiritual guidance. They do not perform labor, relying instead on the people of Rio Sagrado as their workforce. The Chosen view themselves as superior to all others, even those who align with their beliefs, and strictly maintain this hierarchy.

### Beliefs

The Kingdom’s leaders preach that the valley is a divine testing ground, interpreting the great forest as a domain of demonic corruption. The forest’s towering trees, enormous fauna, and the presence of the Ewoks reinforce their belief that it is a cursed place requiring divine intervention. Evangelical doctrines dominate every aspect of life, demanding complete obedience to their interpretation of divine will.

### Relationship with Other Cultures

Rio Sagrado: The Kingdom’s leaders consider the people of Rio Sagrado to be useful but inherently inferior. The Redeemed, Mexica who have embraced evangelicalism and rejected Catholicism, are somewhat accepted but never treated as equals. Catholics, the mainstream Mexica population, are tolerated but viewed with suspicion for their continued adherence to their syncretic Catholic traditions. Heathens, those who secretly worship the old gods, are considered dangerous heretics and are actively persecuted.

Ewoks: The Kingdom refuses to acknowledge the Ewoks as people, instead framing them as satanic creatures to be eradicated. Bounties are placed on Ewoks, and crusades into the forest are seen as both religious duty and practical necessity to protect logging operations.

### Skill Expressions

Kingdom crusaders and clergy possess divine-themed skills, such as:

Holy Light: A combat buff enhancing the strength and morale of allies.

Inquisition: Detects deception or traces of magic in others.
Players aligned with the Kingdom of God gain bonuses for group combat and structured tactics but face penalties for independent actions or deviation from doctrine.

## Rio Sagrado

### Summary

Rio Sagrado is a city under the control of the Kingdom of God, inhabited primarily by people of Mesoamerican descent from the late 1500s to early 1600s, a time when their culture was being forcibly converted by the Spanish. The Mexica population is internally divided into three groups, shaped by the cultural upheavals of their time:

### Society

The city of Rio Sagrado is centered around a monolith claimed early in the valley’s history. Its inhabitants work as laborers, servants, and guides for the Kingdom, navigating their subjugation with a blend of pragmatism and defiance. The Mexica population is divided into:

The Redeemed: Individuals who have superficially abandoned Catholicism and fully embraced the extreme evangelicalism of the Kingdom of God.

The Catholics: The majority who hold to a form of Catholicism heavily influenced by their Mexica roots.

The Heathens: A secretive minority who have fully embraced the old ways of their ancestors, practicing forbidden ceremonies in private.

### Beliefs

The people of Rio Sagrado maintain a syncretic spirituality, blending Catholicism with indigenous traditions. The Redeemed outwardly reject their heritage, while Catholics integrate it into their practices, and Heathens actively preserve it in defiance of the Kingdom’s rule. The great forest beyond the city is seen as both sacred and dangerous, interpreted through their diverse spiritual lenses.

Relationship with Other Cultures

Kingdom of God: The divisions among the Redeemed, Catholics, and Heathens complicate their relationship with the Kingdom. While many outwardly comply, acts of sabotage and quiet defiance persist.

Ewoks: The people of Rio Sagrado consider the Ewoks "Children of Xolotl," mysterious and possibly sacred guardians of the forest. They avoid harming the Ewoks and sometimes leave offerings at the forest’s edge to honor them.

### Skill Expressions

Rio Sagrado characters blend spiritual and practical abilities, often inspired by Catholic and syncretic traditions. These include:

Blessing of Xolotl: A minor healing ability reflecting ancestral connections.

Saintly Protection: Inspired by the intercession of Catholic saints, this skill provides temporary resistance to damage for allies.

Halo of Guadalupe: Creates an aura of calm and courage, reducing fear effects and increasing morale within its radius.

Stigmata: Channels pain into spiritual energy, allowing the user to enhance their physical strength or resistance for a short time.

Spear of Saint Michael: A powerful, targeted attack that pierces through defenses, inspired by the archangel's role as a warrior of light.

Forest Whisper: Enhances tracking and navigation in wooded areas.
Players aligned with Rio Sagrado excel in adaptability, able to negotiate with multiple factions, but they face challenges due to their subjugated status and internal divisions.

## The Ewoks

### Summary

Known as "forest-demons" by the Kingdom of God, the Ewoks are a resilient and resourceful species that inhabit the great forest surrounding the shattered monolith. They have survived through decentralized binding points and guerilla tactics.

### Society

Ewok society revolves around small, interconnected tree villages, each housing a fragment of the shattered monolith. These fragments serve as localized binding points, allowing the Ewoks to respawn within their own territory. The Ewoks’ decentralized structure and intimate knowledge of the forest make them incredibly difficult to eradicate.

### Beliefs

The Ewoks revere the forest as their sacred home. While they do not fully understand the deeper mechanisms behind the shattered monolith, they see the forest’s vitality as a gift to be protected. Spirituality in Ewok society emphasizes harmony with nature and communal resilience.

### Relationship with Other Cultures

Kingdom of God: The Ewoks see the Kingdom as a grave threat and rely on traps, ambushes, and terrain mastery to repel incursions. Their use of monolith fragments has remained hidden from the Kingdom.

Rio Sagrado: Though interactions are rare, the Ewoks have a cautious respect for the residents of Rio Sagrado, recognizing their reverence for the forest and their indirect resistance to the Kingdom.

### Skill Expressions

Ewok characters have unique abilities tied to their environment, such as:

Tree Ambush: Allows stealth attacks from elevated positions.

Fragment Bind: Enables localized respawn points linked to monolith fragments.
Players aligned with the Ewoks benefit from guerilla-style combat and environmental advantages but face limitations due to their isolation.
