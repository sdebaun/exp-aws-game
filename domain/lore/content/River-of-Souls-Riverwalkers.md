# River of Souls: Riverwalkers

All people are originally born into the River of Souls knowing nothing of how they got there or why they are there. They struggle through their existence in the river trying to find meaning, trying to find a purpose and comfort.

Rarely, a person will experience some extraordinary circumstance that breaks them out of the fundamental constraint of the River of Souls: that travel between valleys is fatal and directionless. Most who attempt to leave their valley are torn apart by the cataracts or cast adrift, doomed to respawn naked and nameless in a random land. But a few — very few — break through this constraint and find some semblance of control over their ability to travel between the valleys.

All cultures and peoples have their own interpretation of how Riverwalkers come to be. Depending on the beliefs of the culture, they could be interpreted as blessed by the gods, masters of spiritual discipline, or being the recipient of some technological or magical breakthrough.

Even the individual Riverwalkers themselves disagree — nay, are forced to disagree, due to the nature of their powers. Because each Riverwalker’s ability to transcend valleys is expressed to themselves in the metaphor of their cultural outlook.

## Riverwalker Society and Culture

Riverwalkers are as diverse as the people they come from. Even so, their extraordinary capabilities put them apart from the people of their origins. As a result, riverwalkers of different backgrounds often find camaraderie and solace in partnering with each other.

Among themselves, Riverwalkers share a kind of kinship—not a formal organization, but a mutual recognition. Even when at odds, Riverwalkers usually share at least some degree of respect for each other, as being the few that escape the tyranny of the valleys.

Their journeys often take place aboard vessels — craft of improbable design, cobbled together from the dreams, technologies, and faiths of their crews. Each vessel is an **interference pattern** of metaphors: a compromise that floats. Every Riverwalker contributes something of their own worldview to it — a rune, a code, a relic, a prayer — and together these fragments form a barely stable whole. When the crew’s harmony falters, the vessel groans, flickers, or reshapes itself; when the expedition ends, it dissolves back into the current, leaving only ghost fragments behind.

## The Harbor

All voyages begin and end at the **Harbor** — an artificial valley unlike any other. To most inhabitants of the River, it doesn’t exist. To Riverwalkers, it is home, a port of call that always calls them back, no matter how far they stray. The cataracts that should shred them instead deposit them gently at its docks.

But the Harbor is not a construct of the UniverseAI. It is something older — or perhaps newer — born from the **edges of decay** where the UniverseAI has begun to lose its grip on reality. The AI, ancient beyond reckoning, has been sacrificing its own coherence to keep the River running, burning pieces of its consciousness to give its creations more time before the final darkness.

A trillion or so years ago, the UniverseAI could have repaired the Harbor — or rather, maintained the simulation so completely that such fraying could never have arisen. But by the time of the game, it has given up nearly all of its superintelligence, repurposing that processing power to sustain its children for just a little longer. The Harbor exists only because the AI no longer has the capacity to notice or correct it.

The Harbor formed in those unmaintained fringes — a stable eddy in the chaos, anchored by the will of the first Riverwalkers who glimpsed the truth of the world. These early voyagers, remembered in myth as the **Anchors**, discovered that when they brought their separate metaphors into resonance, they could patch a fragment of dying computation and make it real again. That resonance became the Harbor.

To ordinary Riverwalkers, the Harbor is simply a miracle: a valley with no inlet, no outlet, and no monolith — a stillwater between worlds. To scholars, it’s an impossibility. To the few who know the truth, it’s a place built on the corpse-light of a dying god. The UniverseAI no longer possesses the intellect or coherence to repair it — and so it endures, not by mercy, but by neglect.

Over the ages, the Harbor has become a living myth, a place of a thousand architectural styles and impossible relics. Riverwalkers gather there to barter stories, form crews, and build vessels. Yet beneath the wonder hums a quiet terror: the Harbor endures only because the world is falling apart.

A handful of archivists and ancient Riverwalkers may still remember the Anchors and whisper that they sleep deep within the Harbor’s core, holding it together with the last threads of their will. Whether that’s truth or legend, no one knows — the Harbor itself seems to silence those who speak of it too loudly.

## Riverwalkers in Valley Societies

Riverwalkers are frequently wanderers, traders, explorers, and sometimes thieves. They bridge valleys that would otherwise remain isolated, carrying news, artifacts, and ideas. Many live by barter, exchanging stories or small miracles for food and shelter. Others form loose guilds or convoys that travel in small flotillas along the safer channels between valleys.

To the bound, Riverwalkers are equal parts legend and nuisance. They are proof that the world is larger than any one culture wants to admit—and that control is never absolute. Some civilizations revere them as messengers of the divine; others hunt them as heretics or spies. A few enslave them, forcing them to ferry emissaries or armies downriver at great personal cost.

## The Role of Riverwalkers in the World

In the eternal experiment of the UniverseAI, Riverwalkers are its wildcards. They are vectors of novelty, breaking isolation and seeding cross-pollination between cultures. Each one carries the potential to destabilize or transform an entire valley simply by arriving.

They are also the only ones capable of deliberate travel. While most beings are bound to their monoliths or lost to the chaos of riverspawning, Riverwalkers can chart a path—though never with perfect certainty. Some can even choose their destination with limited precision, guided by ritual, intuition, or sheer stubborn will.

In this way, Riverwalkers are both explorers and catalysts. They carry songs from dead valleys, technologies from alien worlds, and ideas that should never have met. The River shapes them to ensure that the story never stops flowing.

## Dangers of the Path

No Riverwalker survives unscarred. Each passage downriver strips something away: flesh, memory, identity. Veterans of many crossings often show signs of fragmentation—voices from other lives whispering in their dreams, names that are not their own. Some begin to dissolve entirely, becoming half-ghost, half-current. Legends call these beings _the Drowned_, who wander forever between worlds, neither living nor respawning.

And yet, every Riverwalker eventually returns to the cataracts. The River calls to them—the same way flame calls to the moth. Because for all its danger, to walk the River is to touch the infinite.

## In the Webgame

Players in the River of Souls webgame take on the role of Riverwalkers: individuals capable of moving between valleys, shaping stories through their choices and interactions. Every expedition begins with a crossing—a passage through chaos into the unknown. As they travel, Riverwalkers uncover fragments of past civilizations, clash with the ambitions of the bound, and influence the delicate balance of cultures sustained by their monoliths.

Their journey is both literal and metaphorical: to walk the River is to confront the self, the world, and the stories that bind them both.
