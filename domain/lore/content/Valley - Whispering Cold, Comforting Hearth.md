# Valley: Whispering Cold, Comforting Hearth

This valley is a living tapestry of contrasts—a land shaped by glaciers and
fire, technology and tradition, isolation and fragile alliances. At its heart
lies a winding fjord, carved from ice and stone, where towering glaciers and
roaring waterfalls frame the lives of its inhabitants. The valley’s cultures—the
Frost Giants, Conjoiners, Vikings, and Mountain Dwarves—each carve out their own
space in this harsh landscape, driven by ambition, survival, and a shared need
to endure.

# Geography of the Valley

This valley begins at its **inlet**, where the river spills into a majestic
fjord, flanked by towering glaciers. These massive walls of ice creak and groan
with the weight of ancient frost, a sound that echoes through this valley like a
somber hymn. The fjord, though treacherous, is the lifeline of this valley,
carving a path between the icy sentinels. As the river winds downriver, the
glacial walls gradually give way to rugged cliffs and impassable mountains. This
valley’s **outlet** roars with the fury of cascading cataracts and immense
waterfalls, an awe-inspiring sight that marks the transition to the next unknown
domain.

The fjord is not merely a boundary but a dynamic force, with icebergs calving
from the glaciers to drift through the icy waters. The air shimmers with cold
luminescence, lending this valley its shared name -- Coldfire Fjord -- and
imbuing it with an otherworldly beauty. The transition from the glacial inlet to
the rocky outlet mirrors the valley’s shifting challenges, making it a crucible
for those who dare to claim its lands.

## Notable Features

- Glacier Bay: the upriver section of the valley is a cold, tempestous sea
  bounded by edge glaciers at its sides and upriver edge.  Massive icebergs
  frequently calve from the glaciers, which never seem to get any smaller. 
  those icebergs can last many years and be sustained by cultures that have the
  means and will to do so.
- The Cold coast: a windswept and rugged biome that faces the Glacier Bay.  It
  is home to many strange monsters and creatures that make travel and
  exploration difficult -- but the natural resources that can be found can make
  it worth the hazard.
- The Mouth: an opening from Glacier Bay into the fjord proper, which is unto a
  small sea itself. weather here is still fickle, but nothing like the storms
  that usually rage in Glacier Bay.

# The Seeding of the Valley

The valley's current cycle began with its seeding, a chaotic event that brought
disparate cultures into its frozen embrace. From the moment they awoke on the
banks of the fjord, the valley’s new inhabitants were shaped by its harsh beauty
and unyielding terrain. The Frost Giants, roused by the primal call of the
glaciers, quickly laid claim to the inlet, challenging any who dared venture too
close. Meanwhile, the Conjoiners and Vikings, each drawn to the promise of the
fjord’s resources, found themselves in an uneasy proximity along its banks.
Early days were fraught with skirmishes over territory, as Conjoiners sought to
harness the fjord’s energy and the Vikings raided their sleek facilities,
testing the limits of their technological defenses.

Downriver, the Mountain Dwarves faced their own struggles as they carved their
fortresses into the cliffs near the outlet. The unforgiving terrain claimed many
lives, but their tenacity forged a society resilient against both the elements
and the ambitions of their neighbors. Encounters between the cultures often
ended in bloodshed, but moments of cooperation—born of necessity during
particularly harsh winters or in the face of shared threats—hinted at the
fragile balance that would define life in the valley.

# The Valley Today

## The Frost Giants

Throughout Glacier Bay, where the ice reigns supreme, various clans of Frost
Giants established their citadels. These towering beings, embodiments of the
glacier’s wrath, see the ice as both their home and their weapon. Their
crystalline citadels rise from the glacier walls or from free-floating icebergs,
blending seamlessly with the environment. To the Frost Giants, the glaciers are
a sacred place of power, and they fiercely defend it from any who would dare
trespass. Their relationships with the other inhabitants are tenuous at best;
their immense strength and isolationist tendencies make them a force to be
reckoned with but difficult to approach.

Other lesser clans of Frost Giants founded their citadels near the edges, but
within the fjord proper where the glaciers start to give way to mountains.  With
less power from the smaller glaciers at their disposal, they are less developed,
and are more likely to come in conflict with the other cultures.

**Relations With Others:**

- **Conjoiners:** The Frost Giants see them as arrogant interlopers, their
  harvesting of icebergs a blatant violation of what the Giants consider sacred.
  Skirmishes at the edges of Glacier Bay are common, with Giants smashing
  Conjoiner facilities or redirecting drifting icebergs.
- **Vikings:** While less directly invasive, the Vikings occasionally raid
  glacial territories for resources, provoking the ire of the Giants. However,
  the Frost Giants grudgingly respect Viking courage and have even accepted
  tribute from particularly bold clans.
- **Dwarves:** Interaction is minimal, as the distant strongholds of the Dwarves
  rarely threaten Giant dominion. However, some Frost Giants view the mining of
  stone as a needless desecration of the land.

## The Conjoiners

On the **left bank** of the mid-fjord, the Conjoiners have claimed the
transitional zone where the glaciers begin to meet rocky outcrops. These
hyper-advanced posthumans view the valley as a canvas for their technological
vision. They have constructed sleek facilities that tap into the valley’s
geothermal and hydrodynamic energies. For the Conjoiners, the valley’s
challenges are opportunities to test and expand their capabilities.

Despite their technological superiority, the Conjoiners are not invulnerable.
They must balance their ambition with caution, as the valley’s other cultures
view their presence with a mix of awe and suspicion. Tensions run high,
especially with the Vikings, who see the Conjoiners as tempting targets for
raids.

**Relations With Others:**

- **Frost Giants:** The Conjoiners’ harvesting of icebergs brings them into
  sporadic conflict with the Frost Giants, who desire the icebergs to replenish
  their floating citadels.
- **Vikings:** The Conjoiners view the Vikings as an unpredictable nuisance,
  with raids on their facilities creating frequent tension. Some leaders attempt
  to establish trade, but mistrust often derails negotiations.
- **Dwarves:** The Conjoiners are intrigued by the Dwarves’ craftsmanship but
  view their reliance on traditional methods as antiquated. They occasionally
  trade advanced tools for rare minerals, though relations remain cautious.

## The Vikings

On the **right bank** of the mid-fjord, where the icy waters begin to yield to
dense forests, the Vikings have built their foothold. Rugged longhouses and
fortified harbors mark their settlements, perched atop cliffs that overlook the
fjord. The Vikings thrive on the duality of the valley’s environment, combining
seafaring prowess with forested hunting grounds to sustain their clans.

**Relations With Others:**

- **Conjoiners:** The Vikings’ raiding tendencies place them at odds with the
  Conjoiners, whose sleek facilities are both enticing targets and formidable
  defenses. While some Viking leaders attempt to parlay for technological
  advantages, mistrust runs deep.
- **Frost Giants:** The Frost Giants are both a threat and a potential ally;
  Vikings test their limits with daring raids but offer tribute when faced with
  overwhelming Giant power.
- **Dwarves:** The Vikings maintain a precarious balance of trade and conflict
  with the Dwarves. While the dwarven mines offer valuable goods, Viking
  opportunism often leads to raids, souring relations despite occasional mutual
  benefit.

## The Mountain Dwarves

At the valley’s outlet, where the cliffs rise into monumental mountains, the
Mountain Dwarves have carved their realm into the stone. Their fortresses are
marvels of craftsmanship, blending functionality with the grandeur of ancient
traditions. The Dwarves control access to the outlet and guard it jealously,
understanding its strategic importance as both a choke point and a symbol of
stability.

**Relations With Others:**

- **Vikings:** The Mountain Dwarves view the Vikings with wary pragmatism. While
  they trade with Viking clans for resources, they also fortify against raids,
  knowing too well the northerners’ opportunistic tendencies.
- **Conjoiners:** The Dwarves admire the Conjoiners’ technological prowess but
  distrust their unorthodox methods. Occasional trade occurs, but mutual
  suspicion keeps interactions limited.
- **Frost Giants:** Residing far upriver, the Frost Giants have little direct
  contact with the Dwarves. However, their shared sense of territoriality
  fosters a grudging respect between the two cultures.
