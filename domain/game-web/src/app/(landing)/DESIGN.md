## RIVER OF SOULS — LANDING PAGE REDESIGN SPEC

### Concept: “The River Scroll”

---

### **Goal**

Transform the current landing experience from a feature selector (PLAY / GUIDE / READ) into a narrative journey (DISCOVER / GUIDE / CREATE) that mirrors the metaphysics of the River of Souls world.

The page should expose new visitors to the different user experiences from the most casual (discover) to the highest commitment (create), and guide them naturally toward interaction and eventual participation.

---

### **Experience Flow**

The landing page is a **vertical scroll**, divided into three distinct sections representing escalating levels of involvement:

1. **DISCOVER** → observe stories (lowest friction)
2. **GUIDE** → interact with ongoing stories (moderate friction)
3. **CREATE** → start your own quest (highest friction)

A fixed top nav mirrors these three verbs for returning users:
`DISCOVER    GUIDE    CREATE`

As the player scrolls down the page, or uses the top nav to jump around, the top nav visually changes to identify which part of the pitch they're looking at.

---

### **Section 1: DISCOVER the River of Souls**

**Theme:** Observation and awe. The visitor enters the world.
**Visuals:** Wide, slow-moving panorama of a vast river winding into fog. Subtle parallax gives the illusion of drifting forward.

**Copy tone:** Ethereal, invitational.

> “Every story begins as a whisper. Watch it take form.”

**Content**

Reuse the sample narrative text from the existing root landing page.

**Primary CTA:** `Read the Sagas →`

---

### **Section 2: GUIDE the River of Souls**

**Theme:** Influence and choice. The visitor becomes a Fate.
**Visuals:** The river narrows, glowing threads fork and merge. Subtle tendrils of light connect scenes or cards — metaphor for guiding fates.

**Copy tone:** Confident, conspiratorial.

> “Cast your will among the currents. Shape what will be remembered.”

**Content:**

Reuse the content from the existing landing page showing how guides vote for challenges.

**Primary CTA:** `Guide the Stories →` (light sign-in gate)

---

### **Section 3: CREATE the River of Souls**

**Theme:** Commitment and transformation. The visitor becomes a hero/creator.
**Visuals:** The camera dives beneath the river’s surface. Bioluminescent souls drift toward a radiant monolith. The scroll ends at a riverbank view with misted horizon.

**Copy tone:** Purposeful, mythic.

> “Birth a new current. Gather heroes. Begin the next legend.”

**Content:**

The chat log from the existing page.

**Primary CTA:** `Forge Your Quest →` (creates or logs in).

---

### **Navigation & Behavior**

- **Persistent top bar**: `DISCOVER | GUIDE | CREATE` (smooth-scroll anchors).
- **Scroll transitions**: Each section blends via parallax; river acts as unifying visual motif.
- **Color progression:** cool blues → teals → warm golds (discovery → agency → creation).
- **Motion rhythm:** slow, cinematic; no abrupt jumps. The scroll feels like drifting downriver.

---

### **Copy & Tone Guidelines**

- Avoid “play / game / app” terminology. Use mythic verbs.
- Address the user in second person (“you”).
- Mix wonder and agency — _Terry Pratchett meets Neil Gaiman meets Iain Banks._
- Every CTA should sound like an act of myth-making, not a signup.

---

### **Success Criteria**

- Visitors instantly understand the three roles.
- New users engage first by reading; conversion path flows upward (READ → GUIDE → PLAY).
- Returning users can jump directly to their preferred mode via top nav.
- The experience feels like entering a living world, not a software platform.
